### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (LTS)
- [PNPM](https://pnpm.js.org/en/installation) (latest)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.io/tools#client) (for mobile development)

### Recommendations

Development is platform dependant, for Mac OS you can use their emulator for to run and test the app locally. 

For Windows, you can use [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio), or even [Windows Subsystem for Android](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/android/wsa/) to run the app locally.

If you run Linux, you can probably use Android Studio too. 

An alternative for all platforms is to use [Expo Go](https://expo.io/tools#client) to run the app on a real device.

### Running the stack

1. Clone the repository
2. Define environment variables in a `.env` file, take a look at the `.env.example` file for reference
3. Start the docker containers with `docker compose up -d`
2. Run `pnpm install` to install dependencies
3. Change directory to the app you want to run
4. Run `pnpm start` to start the app
